# SDLC Activities

## Activity 1: Requirements Gathering
During this phase, the project team works with stakeholders to gather and document the project's requirements. This involves understanding the needs and expectations of the stakeholders and translating them into actionable requirements.

## Activity 2: System Design
In this phase, the high-level system architecture is designed. This includes defining the overall structure of the system, identifying components and modules, and specifying how they interact with each other.

## Activity 3: Implementation
The implementation phase involves writing code based on the design specifications. Developers write and test the code to ensure that it meets the defined requirements and is free from defects.

## Activity 4: Testing and Quality Assurance
Testing is a crucial phase of the SDLC. It involves identifying and fixing defects in the software. Various testing techniques, such as unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, are performed to ensure the software's quality.

## Activity 5: Deployment and Maintenance
During this phase, the software is deployed to the production environment. Any necessary configurations and setups are performed to make the software accessible to users. After deployment, ongoing maintenance and support activities are carried out to address issues and make improvements as needed.
